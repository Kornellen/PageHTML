        Hey I'm Kornel, author of this Page. This is my biggest html project. I
        don't now what I can put here so I decided to explain myself. I'm 15yo
        and I'm student in middle school, I'm future programer and at this page
        I exercise. I think I'm doing well, but I don't know I'm right. I live
        in Jaroslaw, polish small city in Subcarpathia.
